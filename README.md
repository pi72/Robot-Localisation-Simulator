# Robot-Localisation-Simulator
This is a simulator for implementing and improving localisation and path planning algorithms of an autonomous robot. This simulator has been primarily created for testing the Monte Carlo localisation. The idea is that a robot lost in a known arena would be able to localise itself and move to the target point in the shortest possible time.

To run the simulator, download all the files and run the Robot_Sim.py file. At the moment the simulator can create a lost robot and a set of particles (to be used in the localisation) in a selected Map. The simulator is not complete at the moment. I will finish the measurement, localisation and path planning functions shortly. However localisation and path planning function can be modified to test your prefered algorithms.
